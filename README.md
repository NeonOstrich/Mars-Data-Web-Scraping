# Mars-Data-Web-Scraping
This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on HTML/CSS web scraping using BeautifulSoup.

##Background
In this project I am performing two web scrapings of the websites "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html" and 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html'. With this information, I have generated data tables with the information, printed statements about the data, and performed targeted analysis.

##Organization
Within this repository, you will find this readMe file in addition to two Jupyter Notebook files and a file labeled screenshots. part_1_mars_news.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file which relates to the first website. It contains the code to scrape this news website of all of the titles and summaries of news articles. part_2_mars_news.ipynb is scraping weather data focused on mars. It also contains analysis of temperature and pressure and an investigation into the lengh of a martian year using only the data provided. In the screenshots folder, you will find three screenshots. The first of which shows the scraped news information, and the second two which show analysis of the scraped weather information.
